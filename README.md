Ranking-US-Hospitals
====================

The data for this project comes from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) run by the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data and information about the quality of care at over
FOUR THOUSAND (4,000) Medicare-certied hospitals in the U.S. This dataset essentially covers all major U.S. hospitals. This
dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determining whether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality
care to patients (see http://goo.gl/jAXFX for some background on this particular topic).

The Hospital Compare web site contains a lot of data and we will only look at a small subset. The zip file 
for this assignment contains THREE (3) files:

(1) outcome-of-care-measures.csv: Contains information about THIRTY(30)-day mortality and readmission rates for heart attacks,
heart failure, and pneumonia for over FOUR THOUSAND (4,000) hospitals;

(2) hospital-data.csv: Contains information about each hospital;

(3) Hospital_Revised_Flatfiles.pdf: Descriptions of the variables in each file (i.e the code book).
